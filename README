Some years ago I made a board game clone with an AI
There are some bugs but the AI works reasonable good so that
I'm publishing it again (was already open source on berlios).

How does the game work?

It even works on a Zaurus. You don't know what it is?

AWT. The linux based Zaurus published somewhen near 2000
